        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 bone-in rib-eye steak</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tbsp canola oil</li>
            <li>3 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
            <li>2 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Using paper towels, pat both sides of the steak dry; season generously with 1 1/4 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
 </li> 
 <li>Heat a medium cast iron skillet over medium high heat until very hot, about 1-2 minutes; add canola oil.
</li>
<li>Place the steak in the middle of the skillet and cook, turning every 2-3 minutes, until a dark crust has formed on both sides, about 12-14 minutes.
</li>
<li>Reduce heat to medium low. Push steak to one side of the skillet; add butter, garlic, thyme and rosemary to opposite side of the skillet, tilting the skillet towards the butter and cooking until butter is foaming, about 30 seconds to 1 minute.
</li>
<li>Working carefully, spoon butter over steak for 1-2 minutes, turning over once, until it reaches an internal temperature of 120 degrees F for medium rare, or until desired doneness. Let rest 15 minutes before slicing.
</li>
<li>Serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
